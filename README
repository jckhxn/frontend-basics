This is to demomnstrate a basic understanding of the related framework.

Run Sample React Project.
cd /reactJS/basic-todo
npm start
* An overview of how this app was built*
Built a standard App component that returns a input and button.
a function to take the input and save it to state with useSate & localStorage
Using useEffect to load any existing todos or setup the empty array.
useRef allows you to access the value of the input set in the DOM.

Run Angular
cd /react/basic-todo
ng serve --open
* An overview of how this app was built*

In the app.component.ts export
initially set empty array and input value
todos: string[] = [];
todoText = '';

Set the intial setup on render to grab and parse from localStorage
and set todos array  if a value was found or empty if not.
defined addTodo function

in app.component.html I set the basic frontend of the component
Using the *ngFor directive to perform an array loop, listing all todos.
ngSubmit="addTodo()" binds to the addTodo function defined before.
Using [(ngModel)]="todoText" we bind data to todoText in app.component.ts

Imported Angular Forms Module in app.module.ts
